# Documentation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `Get Started`

This repository contains the source code for the [Whichride App Landing Page](https://whichride-ui.netlify.app/)!

A basic landing page that:

- Presents the main theme of the Whichride platform.
- Shows how the app works, about the app and simple form to contact the company.
- Built in the following languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript (with React as a front end library of choice)

### `Running Locally`

- Clone the project repository over HTTPS by running `git clone https://github.com/AregbesolaOJ/whichride-ui.git` in your directory on the local terminal.
- Run `npm install` and `npm start` to install all necessary dependencies and create a local instance respectively, which should default to running on port 3000.
- Verify that your local instance is ALIVE in a browser by accessing `http://localhost:3000/`. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Learn More`
